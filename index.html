			<ul>
				<li><strong>1971</strong> - Musk was born on June 28, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.</li>
				<li><strong>1989</strong> - At age 17, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.</li>
				<li><strong>1992</strong> - Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.</li>
				<li><strong>1995</strong> - Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation with his brother, Kimbal Musk. </li>
				<li><strong>1999</strong> - Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.</li>
				<li><strong>2002</strong> - Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</li>
				<li><strong>2008</strong> - SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.</li>
